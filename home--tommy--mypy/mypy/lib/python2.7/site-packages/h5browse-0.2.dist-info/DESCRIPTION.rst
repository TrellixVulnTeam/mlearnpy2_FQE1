h5browse (formerly dataviz) is a utility for browsing HDF5 files.

It was developed for analyzing neuronal simulation data saved in a
custom format. But the interface is generic enough to display simple
HDF5 files. The tools are totally for neuronal data analysis. But the
plan is to make it a more general tool.

As of 2015-12-21, it supports displaying the tree structure of an HDF5
file, node attributes and dataset contents. You can select arbitrary
fields in a dataset for displaying X-Y plots.

Implementation of editing HDF5 is incomplete.

Note that being based on h5py library it inherits the limitations of
the same.

This is a rewrite of the old code. Replaced PyQwt with
PyQtGraph. Written from scratch in Python 3. Compatible with
Python2.7.
